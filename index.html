			<h2 class='h2intro'>Towards A Better Tomorrow</h2>
			<p>Through war, famine, political crisis, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and other times of trial and tribulation, our current world may at first glance seem to be a hopelessly chaotic environment. However, with all the pain that these times can bring, they also can bring out the best in humanity. Recently I witnessed this firsthand, as my home state of Texas came together through horrible natural disaster, seeing everyday people from all walks of life rescuing others from floodwaters, and providing a bevy of other volunteer services for their neighbors and greater community, reaffirming my belief that together, we all can make a difference towards bringing a better tomorrow.</p>

			<h2 class='h2intro'>My Vision And Philosophy</h2>
			<p>I firmly believe in the humanity of mankind. Since running my first call as a volunteer firefighter at the age of 18, I have tried to make an impact on my community, and the world in general. I envision a future where many more remote areas across the globe have access to adequate emergency services and health care. The application of web development, and coding in general, has the potential for great impact in the approach to this problem, in terms of training, activation, response, and much more. It is my philosophy that my vision, and those of others, can be reached through commitment, compassion, and collaboration.</p>

			<p>I was born, raised, and educated in Houston, Texas. I have worked as a cattle rancher, a carpenter, and in various clinical and research capacities in the medical field. Starting as a young adult, I have been active in emergency services (Fire and EMS) both in a paid and volunteer capacity. Beginning ten years ago, I discovered the joy of independent international travel as a backpacker. Since then, I have balanced making a livable earning with traveling the globe, and participating worldwide in volunteer endeavors. In my free time at home I enjoy various forms of exercise, and spending time with my nieces and nephews. I currently reside in the Houston area, but will be permanently moving to Guatemala at the end of next year. This decision was made following an 80-day stay there beginning this last March. While in Guatemala, I inadvertently made the discovery that there is a definitive link to my endeavor of bringing access to emergency services and health care to rural areas abroad, and the exciting and evolving field of web development and software engineering.</p>

			<h2>My Journey Into Coding</h2>
			<p>Before this year, my experience with computers was basic functions such as spreadsheets, word processing, and so forth. I had one computer course in my life under my belt, dating back to high school. Upon discovering, through one of my community initiatives, that we desperately needed access to programmers in Guatemala, and with few economically viable options available, I became determined to learn this new skill set to further my volunteer endeavors, provide a means to remotely make a living wage while residing and traveling overseas, and to enable me to establish a program in Guatemala to teach new coders free of cost. I recently began teaching myself to code using online resource, and I see the Founders &amp; Coders program as a way to fulfill that learning process, while simultaneously exposing me to the resources and experience I need to bring more coding educational opportunities to Guatemala.</p>

			<p>In March of this year I made what was intended to be a 21-day trip to Guatemala. After initially seeing “the sights”, I spent the next two months in a remote region in the northwest of the country amongst the Ixil Mayans, and became involved in their limited emergency services and clinical care there. Through a chance meeting with another American (a rarity in that region), I realized that my goal of bolstering both of these vital services could exponentially benefit from coding, as I explained above. When I permanently relocate there next year, I will bring with me a new set of skills, and hopefully the ability to launch a program to train future generations of developers there.</p>

			<p>In 2009, I made an impromptu trip to Israel, packing a backpack in less than an hour. I went with no plans, no reservations, and no experience “backpacking”. During my sixteen days in Israel (I also spent 10 days in Egypt), while learning the ropes of backpacking, I traveled to Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Eilat, Beersheva, Ein Gedi on the Dead Sea, Tiberias, and into the West Bank to Bethlehem, Jericho, and Ramallah. To this day Israel remains one of my favorite countries, and I am delighted that the opportunity exists to combine my current endeavors with an extended stay there. I know the land, the people, and the entire Middle East region in general, and am prepared to relocate there for the Founders &amp; Coders Nazareth program, and the subsequent commitment to mentoring the following cohort.</p>
